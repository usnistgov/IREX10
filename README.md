# IREX
IREX 10 is a continuing evaluation of automated iris recognition technology.  Administered at the Image Group's Biometrics Research Laboratory (BRL), developers submit their matching software for analysis over sequestered test data.  As an ongoing evaluation, developers may submit their software at any time.

# Validation 
Validation is the process of ensuring a participant's submission is functioning properly on NIST's test machines. It involves running the submission over a set of data and verifying it matches the output provided by the participant.

To produce validation output and prepare your submission, first get the password to decrypt the validation images by emailing [irex@nist.gov](mailto:irex@nist.gov), then place your library file in the current directory and execute ./validate.sh and follow the instructions.

# Notes
NIST will test submissions on Ubuntu 20.04 (gcc version 9.3.0), downloadable from https://nigos.nist.gov/evaluations/ubuntu-20.04.3-live-server-amd64.iso
